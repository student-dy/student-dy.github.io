								<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
								<p>A <b>user interface</b> is a physical or virtual medium that enables people and systems to communicate. 
									This user interface is the key to the scientific facts and technologies found in the research to be used in real life. 
									Products with a well-interacting user interface are more intuitive and highly valued in the marketplace. 
									I was involved in this field as doing ‘2-Player Interactive Game’ as the project of the <em>Interaction Prototyping</em> lecture that I took last semester. 
									The project uses Arduino and Processing to envision a device for accessibility and I had to do everything from design to production, from hardware to software overall. 
									In this process, I was able to experience product design and user interface construction process considering the complex factors such as user's needs, environment as well as design. 
									In addition, I took the <em>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</em> lecture in the same semester, and I learned about the <b>conversational user interface(CUI)</b> which is used for robot and the <b>interface agent</b> which is the basis of the previous one. 
									The conversational user interface applies to a number of AI services currently in use, from simple chatbot to <i>Apple's Siri</i> and <i>Samsung's Bixby</i>. 
									And the interface agent executes or converts the program according to the user's request. 
									<u>What I am most interested</u> in is a methodology for more efficient and accurate design of above two; <b>CUI and interface agent</b>.

								<h2>Reason to Come RMIT</h2>
								<p>I have studied in KAIST after the Gifted Science Highschool, so I could experience Korean science and engineering society closer than anyone else, 
									but I also had a desire for a wider world and a higher dream. 
									<u>I felt that the RMIT and Australia would be the best way to <b>broaden my horizons in academia and to set goals specifically for the vague future</b>.</u>
									Also, I thought it is essential for my current situation. 
									Therefore, I have applied to the exchange student program. 
									After the exchange student period finished, I will return to KAIST to continue my studies and grow into a talented person with expertise in this field. 
									I sincerely hope to have the opportunity to move further towards my dreams in a new place where excellent and enthusiastic people come together.
								</p>

								<h2>Expect to Learn</h2>
								<p>I am interested in software rather than hardware in computing. 
									An efficiency at the development stage and a maintenance after delivery are all critical to building successful software. 
									What I mostly want to gain from the university is a basic qualification and recognition to be a good developer, not just a degree. 
									Now I am most interested in the UI, but I want to get more confident about what I want to do and like. 
									In order to do this, I would like to learn about <b>various difficulties in the implementation of software</b> through this course <em>Intro to IT</em>, which is the most basic course in IT field. 
									Also, I want to learn <b>the knowledge of contemporary IT areas, software and applications required to enter the IT market</b>. 
									By the practical application of the knowledge gained from the theoretical content, eventually I hope to set my specific goal and ideal job after this semester.
