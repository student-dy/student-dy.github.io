								<h2>Description of Ideal Job</h2>
								<p>I want to be a technician and Software engineer of Korean online platform company, “NAVER”. 
									Especially, the bigdata and AI platform software engineer seems to be attractive. 
									As of September 2017, the search engine handled 74.7% of all web searches in Korea and it is also constantly referred to as 'the Google of South Korea'. 
									The “Naver” is one of the best companies in Korea and I liked their business ethics. 
									Majority of Korean society has a vertical corporate culture, however the “Naver” disregards it and respects individual opinions and creativity through horizontal employee relations. 
									I want to be the “Naver”'s s/w engineer and hope to provide more innovative services and even richer meaningful content to user.
								</p>

								<h2>Skills Required</h2>
								<h4> 1) Experience of project using Java/ Python/ C/ C++ </h4>
								<h4> 2) Development with Linux environment</h4>
								<h4> 3) Excellent problem analysis and resolution ability </h4>
								<h4> 4) Experience in distributed computing or high availability systems </h4>
								<hr />
								
								<h2>Skills Already Have</h2>
								<h4> 1) Various projects carried out during the undergraduate course of KAIST </h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Experience of project using Java/ Python/ C</li>
										<li>Excellent problem analysis and resolution ability</li>
									</ul>
								<h4> 2) R&D S/W Engineering Internship, CMES, Seoul, South Korea (12/2017-02/2018)</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Worked for R&D Programmer Group</li>
										<li>3D Image Scanning and Machine Vision Company</li>
										<li>Made the communication interface module between the robot and Pick-it server</li>
									</ul>
								
								<hr />
								
								<h2>My Plan and Ambition</h2>
								<p>I am going to enter <b>the graduate school of KAIST</b> after completing undergraduate course at same uni. 
									I will apply to the <b>"Naver"'s industry-university scholarship student</b> at the same time to pursue research and internship at the same time. 
									The technology of the Korean IT industry is the best in the world. AI has been attracting attention for a long time  
									but since it has only recently been introduced in the real industry.
									So <u>the algorithm that manages and learns with large amount of data</u> is a key point of view. 
									Considering the impact of research outcomes on our lives and technological advances of IT industry, 
									I thought that it would be a task to attract attention in the future. 
									Therefore, after graduating from my bachelor's degree, the primary goal is to go into a lab that conducts research in this area.
