								<h2>Meaning of Results</h2>
								<p>I am such an <b>executive person and visual&tactile learner</b>. I can recognize the strength of others help bring those individuals’ ideas to the table. 
									Because executives show clear and consistent tendencies, I’d like to feel like being a part of the team, and a part of the greater organization that working for. 
									As a visual and tactile learner, I learn by reading and seeing pictures or touching and doing. 
									I understand and remember things by sight as well as physical movement. 
									For openness, conscientiousness, extraversion and agreeableness, I got moderate properties.
								</p>
								<hr />
								
								<h2>How Influence?</h2>
								<p>For most entities, I got an average score and did not deviate to one side. 
									That is why I can work well with all members who have a different characteristic. 
									Even if there are members of two different tendencies, I can play a role in coordinating between them. 
									Sometimes I have the ability to lead the team in proper direction with strong leadership.
								</p>
								<hr />
								
								<h2>Forming a Team</h2>
								<p>I have a neutral tendency, so if I meet members who are similar to me, I may proceed with the team activity without a friction. 
									Also, it is possible to lead a good result through coordination with members with distinct tendencies. 
									Especially, since the visual and tactile style were strong in the learning style test, it is necessary to have and communicate with an auditory oriented team member. 
									I think that realistic and visual effects are important and well accepted, so if I take the user interface or front-end part of the IT project, I could make it with great responsibility.
