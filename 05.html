								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>Weather based smart alarm application- 
									The majority of students and worker, including me, take various kinds of vehicles to reach their own place. 
									If you unexpectedly find your window being splashed with rain or snow in the morning, you would most likely be late for not being able to ride your bike or traffic congestion. 
									It would be great if all of us had thoroughness to check the weather of the next day before going to sleep, but it usually doesn’t work that way. 
									Therefore, I propose an alarm that smartly sets its alarm time differently from the originally set time depending on weather and user customization.
								</p>
								<hr />
								
								<h2>Motivation</h2>
								<p>Schedule depends on many factors. One of the crucial factors is weather. 
									To verify whether it’s a good day to go on a picnic or amusement park the next day, most of the people check the weather of the D-day. 
									Besides these special occasions, however, not much portion of the people check on weather of the ordinary days. 
									Also, the weather forecast might change while asleep. 
									I have finally found a way to keep us being lazy and still be able to get on time even under an unexpected weather.

								<h2>Description</h2>
								<p>ABCE
								</p>

								<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
								<p>Since this application is a smartphone application, it requires an Android OS or a device that supports IOS. 
									In addition, GPS and alarm function for obtaining positional information are needed. 
									An Internet connection is also required to receive weather information. 
									To develop, the Android Studio Tool or the Xcode Platform is needed depending on the operation environment of the target device.
								</p>
								<hr />
								
								<h2>Skills Required</h2>
								<p>In order to operate on a device supporting Android OS, it is necessary to develop the application on the Android Studio Tool based on Linux OS and Java language. 
									Besides, to operate on IOS device, development on Xcode Platform based on Mac OS Is needed. 
									On the front-end side, it is need to create the icons and pictures and place them in the proper places so that users can know each function intuitively. 
									Also, it should be able to improve the problem through testing. 
									It is a good idea to classify and document functional and nonfunctional requirements as needed so that development of application can be done systematically.
								</p>
								<hr />
								
								<h2>Outcome</h2>
								<p>The final output of this project will be in application form. 
									This application provides an alarm clock which can be used to set the alarm time. 
									With this application, we will be free from lateness and schedule fluctuations that we had to accept because of the weather before, and we can lead a better life. 
									In addition, during the course of this project, I can learn skills and abilities as a developer while experiencing the software development phases.
